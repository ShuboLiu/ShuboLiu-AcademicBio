After carrying the corresponding task load, it can realize ultra-long-distance control of more than 1000 kilometers and rapid forword data collection based aritifical intelligence, which can be used for security patrols, fire field modeling, route inspections, battlefield surveying and other scenarios.

5G-UAV · H7 was first released at the 4th International Innovation and Entrepreneurship Expo (IIEE) in December 2019, and attracted the attention of many representatives participating in the conference.
