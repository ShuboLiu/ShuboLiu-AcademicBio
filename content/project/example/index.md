NIUVS Open Sources Scheme is proposed by NIUVS (Northwest Intelligent Unmanned Vehicle System) Team in 2020. It focus on the reserch and development of neted intelligent unmanned vehicle systems, intending to offer an open sources platform to develop unmaned system technology. We hope to "Let Unmanned Vehicle Benifits More".

5G-UAS project tends to develop Neted Aerial Vehicle that can be remotely controled via 5G (5th generation mobile communication) network. Based on which, one could develop all kind of 5G based intelligent industial applications.
